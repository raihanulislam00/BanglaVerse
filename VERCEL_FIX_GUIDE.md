# ðŸ”§ Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Diagnosis
Your Vercel deployment is showing a directory listing instead of your React app. This happens because Vercel can't find your built application files.

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution 1: Deploy Frontend Separately (RECOMMENDED)

### Step 1: Create New Vercel Project
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import **only the Frontend folder** (not the entire repository)

### Step 2: Configure Project Settings
```
Framework Preset: Vite
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist
Install Command: npm install
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
Go to Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables and add:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://banglaverse-backend-api.vercel.app
```

### Step 4: Deploy
Click "Deploy" and your app should work!

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution 2: Fix Current Deployment

If you want to keep deploying from the root:

### Step 1: Update Project Settings
In your Vercel dashboard:
```
Build Command: cd Frontend && npm run build
Output Directory: Frontend/dist
Install Command: cd Frontend && npm install
```

### Step 2: Redeploy
Click "Deployments" â†’ "Redeploy" â†’ "Use existing Build Cache: NO"

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution 3: Use CLI Deployment

### From Frontend Directory:
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run build
npx vercel --prod
```

## ðŸš¨ Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in Vercel:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://banglaverse-backend-api.vercel.app
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

## âœ… Verification

After deployment, your app should:
- Show the BanglaVerse interface (not directory listing)
- Load without 404 errors
- Have working translation functionality

## ðŸ”„ Alternative: Switch to Netlify

If Vercel continues to have issues, Netlify works better for React SPAs:

1. Build your project: `npm run build`
2. Go to [netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
3. Drag your `Frontend/dist` folder
4. Instant deployment! âœ¨
